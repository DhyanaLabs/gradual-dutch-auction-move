> This paper introduces the Gradual Dutch Auction, 1 or GDA, a mechanism that enables efficient sales of assets that do not have liquid markets. GDAs solve a similar problem to TWAMM, but do not rely on the existence of liquidity providers willing to make markets on pairs of assets. GDAs work by breaking up a sale into a sequence of Dutch auctionsâ€”a type of auction that start with a high asking price that is gradually lowered until a buyer makes a bid. GDAs allow you to purchase multiple of these auctions at once in a gas-efficient manner.
